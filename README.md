# Tower-Offense
  A basic test for a Tower Defense computer game, but the concept is reversed
# About
  The Main file is located in the TowerFrame class.
  When this project is complete, it will be a game similar in style to a TowerDefense game, but instead of building towers, you will be sending the units and destroying towers on the way. 
  Right now only two types os units exist, and they are extremely basic. the code is also not really optimized and full of comments and pseudocode that can get confusing to navigate. Really this is not yet code that should be used, but rather is a starting place for me to understand how to create larger projects.
